              When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase food and/or drink items. 
              We reserve the right to decline any order for any reason.

            <p>
              As our food is prepared fresh to order, cancellations are generally not possible once preparation has started. 
              If there is an issue with your order, please contact the specific store immediately. 
              Refunds are issued at the discretion of the management.

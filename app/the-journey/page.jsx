                        "While we lived nearby in Hitchin, we spent much of our childhood at our grandad’s off-licence in Westmill. We grew up playing in the park next door and bringing him dinner during his shifts.",
                        "That shop was more than a business to our family; it was a local landmark, and the customers were familiar faces we saw year after year. We watched our grandad treat everyone who walked through the door with genuine respect, building a reputation where neighbours still ask after him fondly decades later.",
                        "Growing up around that counter shaped how we see the world. Our grandad and our father taught us that if you 'Look after your customers and stand by your principles, the business side will take care of itself.' We learned early on that being a local business owner means more than just a transaction; it’s about being a familiar face on the corner.",
                        "These principles weren't just lessons from the past; they became our lifeline when our community faced its biggest challenge yet."

                        "In March 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world went into lockdown, but the needs of our community didn't stop. While everyone stayed inside, we knew we couldn't just sit behind a counter.",
                        "We remember it clearly, a phone call from an elderly lady who was upset and worried. She had no family nearby and hadn't been able to get a supermarket delivery for days. Even though she lived 30 minutes away, we loaded the car and went to her.",
                        "That one delivery sparked something much bigger. Soon, we were delivering groceries all over the area, and the operation grew so quickly that the whole community began volunteering to help us drop off food. It was never about creating extra business or revenue, it was about helping our neighbours when they had no one else to turn to.",
                        "It is incredible to look back and realise that those deliveries during COVID-19 are the very reason we were able to bring Peckers to life. Because we supported the community in their time of need, the council saw our dedication and gave us the chance to open our doors. We didn't just buy a site, we earned a place in the heart of Hitchin, Westmill, and the surrounding areas, through years of mutual support and trust.",
                        "With the community's blessing and our family's values as our compass, we decided to turn our lifelong passion into a new kind of neighbourhood landmark."

For cultural reasons, we grew up only eating chicken and lamb. This lifelong connection to chicken, combined with a genuine love for business, led us to spot a gap in the market for a high-quality, quick-serve restaurant that didn't compromise on service.",
                        "Opening Peckers Hitchin in 2023 was a surreal, 'full circle' moment. Standing on the same spot where our grandfather started his shop over 50 years ago, we realised that while the product has changed, the mission hasn't. As we look toward 2026 and our dream of taking Peckers across the UK, we promise to keep that family-run feel alive.",
